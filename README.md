PROBLEM STATMENT :

The global smartphone industry is one of the fastest-evolving markets, driven by rapid technological advancements, shifting consumer preferences, and intense competition among brands.
However, there is no central, easy-to-use analytical tool that helps users understand:
How smartphone brand market shares change over time
How regions differ in smartphone adoption
What trends drive growth or decline
How operating systems compete globally
How future smartphone market performance can be predicted
This project aims to solve this gap by providing a data-driven, visual, and accessible platform to analyze and interpret global smartphone market trends using charts, datasets, and forecasting models.
